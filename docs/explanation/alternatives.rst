Alternative construction methods and materials

Arm materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stiff card is a good building material for the arms of either a BrachioGraph or a :ref:`PantoGraph
<how-to-pantograph>`, but it's not the only one.

Wooden sticks are easily available, and have similar rigidity, and the advantage that they don't
require cutting.

Using a clothes-peg as a pen-holder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  note::

    This is the current state-of-the-art of the BrachioGraph, and the recommended design. The
    documentation will be more fully updated in due course.

The photograph below illustrates an improved arrangement for the arms and pen-holder. The arms in
this arrangement can qually well be constructed from card.

A clothes peg functions as a pen-holder, allowing different drawing implements to be used - for
example, a pencil or a stick of artist's charcoal. Very soft pens on textured paper, or charcoal,
can work well without any extra weight on the pen).

One minor advantage of this arrangement is that the outer arm is stiffer, thanks to its vertical
orientation and the bracing of the peg; another is that the elbow clears the drawing surface.
