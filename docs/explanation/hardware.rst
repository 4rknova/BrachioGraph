The Raspberry Pi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Raspberry Pi Zero is perfectly adequate to control and power the servos. The Pi can be connected to a host by USB,
using the OTG mode (RNDIS), and powered that way, along with all three servos - but this arrangement is not wholly
reliable and you may find that the machine occasionally reboots, because of lack of power. A separate power supply for
the Pi is much more reliable.

The servo motors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `SG90 analog motors <http://www.towerpro.com.tw/product/sg90-analog/>`_ are ideal to get started with. There are many
  motors from different manufacturers in this class, that weigh about 9g and have approximately 180 degrees rotation.
* *Futaba S3001* motors, which are larger, more powerful and more accurate, worked well and produced even better
  results.


About servo motors and how to choose them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that while more powerful motors produce better results, they will also draw more current and your
Raspberry Pi may struggle to meet the demand.

SG90 motors are **analog**. Analog motors use a small circuit to convert the pulse-widths into motor angles.
**Digital** servo motors also exist, including digital versions of the SG90; they tend to be faster and more powerful.

However, *small digital motors do not work well*. They are twitchy and try to correct for errors much faster than
analog motors. This means that in a mechanism such as this, they quickly start oscillating wildly, as each movement
overshoots and corrects (this is made worse by having two motors affecting each other).

More powerful digital servo motors have not been tested. Please share your experiences using other motors.

For the pen-lifting servo, the lighter and smaller the better. Power and accuracy are not required.


Beware of fakes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Counterfeit motors are very common. Many of the motors sold as Tower Pro SG90 are in fact fakes. They are cheaper and
of lower quality. If motors sold as SG90s are priced below â‚¬3 or $3 each, they are probably fake.

The arms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using card for the arms, it needs to be stiff in both directions. Picture-mounting board is ideal. A
picture-framing shop will almost certainly give you free off-cuts.

:ref:`Wooden sticks as illustrated <get_started>` don't require cutting and are easy to obtain.
