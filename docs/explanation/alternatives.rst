Alternative construction methods and materials
----------------------------------------------

Stiff card is a good building material for the arms of either a BrachioGraph or a :ref:`PantoGraph
<how-to-pantograph>`, but it's not the only one.

The photograph below illustrates various alternative options.

In the place of card, wooden sticks are used.

A clothes peg functions as a pen-holder, allowing different drawing implements to be used - for
example, a pencil or a stick of artist's charcoal. Very soft pens on textured paper, or charcoal,
can work well without any extra weight on the pen).

One minor advantages of this arrangement is that the outer arm is stiffer, thanks to its vertical
orientation and the bracing of the peg; another is that the elbow clears the drawing surface.
